        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Tyrrell's Michele Alboreto scored his second Grand Prix win and first points of the season, after inheriting
          the lead from Nelson Piquet with just nine laps to go when the Brabham driver stopped to replace a deflating
          rear tire. The tight downtown street course took away much of the advantage of the turbocharged cars. Over
          70,000 fans enjoyed beautiful weather for the race on Sunday. The boats on the Detroit River, the blaring
          music and the floods of people from the downtown hotels created quite an atmosphere, inevitably bringing
          comparisons to Monaco, as the Long Beach event often did.<br></p>
        <h3>The race</h3>
        <p>
          The first attempt at a start was halted just as the green light was about to come on, when Andrea de Cesaris
          signalled from the grid that his Alfa Romeo had stalled. The whole process was begun again, with another pace
          lap that reduced the race distance from 61 laps to 60, and this time the green light came on. This time,
          however, Patrick Tambay's Ferrari, in the second row, stalled on the grid! He held his breath while everyone
          made their way safely around him, and then, expecting a push-start, instead was removed from the circuit by
          tow truck!
        </p>
        <p>Piquet made an excellent start and beat Arnoux to Turn One. He led after the first lap, with Arnoux
          ahead of de Angelis. The two leaders quickly began to separate themselves from the rest, while a four-way
          nose-to-tail battle raged for fourth. On lap five, Cheever retired with ignition failure, de Angelis forfeited
          third place with a broken gearbox. Arnoux, after steadily closing the gap to Piquet, overtook the Brabham into
          Turn One and gained the lead on lap 10, but on lap 32 just three laps after his pit stop, Arnoux suddenly
          coasted to a halt on the circuit with an electrical failure.
        </p>
        <p> When Laffite pitted, Piquet was back in the lead,
          with Alboreto up to second and Rosberg third, 25 seconds back. Suddenly, on lap 51, Piquet slowed with a
          punctured left rear tire, and as he made his way back to the pits, Alboreto and Rosberg went by. All that was
          left was for Alboreto to bring the Tyrrell home over the final nine laps, taking it rather easy since he was
          too far in front for Rosberg to catch him.</p>
