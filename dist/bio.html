        <p class="drop-cap">Michele
          Alboreto is just that:
        </p>
        <p>The extraordinary story
          of a boy who, like so many others, followed the races
          behind the metal fences of the Monza racetrack,
          and in a few years he became the final Italian driver to claim victory in a Grand Prix behind the wheel of a
          Ferrari</p>
        <p>
          Neither rich, nor daddy's boy, he did not belong to a
          generation of "kart drivers".</p>

          <p>Born in Milan on December 23, 1956, he made his debut in
            world of racing in 1976 at the wheel of a
            “Formula Monza” of Scuderia Salvati. Hungry for
            victory, animated by a "young rage", he showcased himself as an authentic aggressive driver—much like his
            idol, the legendary Ronnie Peterson. It was from Peterson that he adopted the blue and yellow colors of his
            helmet.</p>

      <div class="py-1 text hidden">
        <p>Two years later, in "Formula Italia," his victory in Magione opened the doors of Formula 3, which was
          no small feat in the late seventies. Already a vice-champion in his first year, he claimed the top spot in
          1980. During the same year, he was also recruited by Lancia for the endurance championship.</p>
        <p>In 1981, in F2 with Minardi. he imposed himself at Misano
          against the official March and Spirit teams, achieving the
          only triumph in the history of the Minardi team. In addition to new victories with the Lancia LMP1, thanks to
          the 'mediation' of some friends, came the call from Ken Tyrrell.</p>

          <p>
            The great talent scout of the Formula 1 Circus offered him a seat for the San Marino GP. He exploited the
            opportunity well, and his apprenticeship in F1 continued for the rest of the championship and the following
            year. Still driving for the Tyrrell team, the breakthrough came with the incredible victory in Las Vegas in
            the last race of the season.

        <p> Enzo Ferrari put aside his proverbial xenophilia and began to keep an eye on him. In 1983, he gave another
          victory to Tyrrell and the glorious Ford Cosworth, marking the last victory in their history on the Detroit
          street circuit. By this time, he had become one of the best drivers in the world."</p>
        <p>At the end of the season, a McLaren offer was on the table. However, when the call from Enzo Ferrari came
          in
          October of that year, Michele didn't hesitate: from 1984 onwards, he would be a Ferrari driver alongside
          Renè
          Arnoux.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text hidden py-1">
        <p>An Italian driver had been absent from the Ferrari team for eleven years, dating back to the distant
          era of Arturo Merzario.</p>
        <p>
          In that year, another important event took place in his life his marriage to Nadia, his lifelong love. Their
          relationship had blossomed during his youth on the outskirts of Milan (Rozzano), a place he never
          forgot,always staying close to his childhood friends

            In 1984 the McLarens of Lauda and Prost were superior but Michele got his first historic victory at Zolder
            in red and then gives the "home" fans a nice second place in Monza. The wait is for the following year and
            with the new 156/85 Ferrari takes off at the start of the season.</p>

          After excellent placements, Alboreto wins in Canada but his greatest triumph is at the Nurburgring, where he
          leaps to the top of the World Championship and his world ambitions are
          concrete. An incredible series of engine failures, however, will deliver the title to Prost and
          (again)
          to McLaren, leaving him the place of honor and a bitter taste in the mouth.</p>

          <p>It's a missed opportunity; an Italian World Champion has been absent since the heroic era of another
            Milanese driver, Alberto Ascari. After a disappointing 1986 season, Ferrari embarked on a new technical
            journey with John Barnard at the helm. Meanwhile, Alboreto's new teammate, the
            Austrian driver Gerhard Berger, achieved victories in Japan and Australia during the 1987 season.</p>

          In 1988, McLaren's dominance was almost unbroken, except for a remarkable exception at Monza. Only a month
          had passed since Enzo Ferrari's passing, and the Ferrari team managed to achieve a remarkable double victory
          filled with emotion and significance on the Brianza circuit, which hosts the Italian Grand Prix.

          <p>Alboreto secured the second position on the podium, surrounded by a sea of red flags, as he bid farewell to
            the Ferrari team and the Cavallino Rampante (Ferrari's symbol).
            Shortly before his passing, Enzo Ferrari had called Alboreto to Maranello. With Nigel Mansell set to join
            the
            team the following year, the decision was still in the hands of the influential Ferrari Chief. Despite the
            possibility of contract renewal, Alboreto decided to move on.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="py-1 text hidden">
        <p>
          For the 1989 season, after the possibility of join Williams has faded, Alboreto returned to where his Formula
          One journey began:
          the blue Tyrrell 017. Despite limited resources and lacking major sponsors, he achieved an incredible
          third-place finish in Mexico, marking his final podium appearance in the sport.</p>
        <p>
          During a mid-season contractual issues, he moved on to
          the modest Larrousse team, followed by stints at Footwork (achieving some respectable results in 1992) and
          the
          Scuderia Italia (a challenging year). In 1994, he reunited with his old team Minardi. Tragically, amidst the
          events of Imola, he comprehended that Ayrton Senna's fatal accident would profoundly transform the sport's
          atmosphere.

      </div>

      <div class="text hidden py-1">

          Alboreto secured a splendid sixth place in Monaco, his final race that garnered a point, culminating his
          illustrious and extensive Formula One career spanning 215 Grands Prix and 5 victories.
        </p>
        <p>The decision to continue his career proved to be wise for
          Alboreto. In 1997, his collaboration with the Joest team, driving a Porsche, led to a victory at the 24
          Hours
          of Le Mans. Two years later, as the team transitioned into the Audi team, Alboreto embarked on a quest for
          a
          repeat victory in the iconic French race.

      <div class="py-1 flex">
        <div class="text hidden">
          <p>The year 2001 began with promising prospects. Alongside teammates Capello and Aiello, Alboreto triumphed in
            the 12 Hours of Sebring, driving the Audi R8.</p>
          <p>On April 25th, a Wednesday, Alboreto's tragic accident occurred. While testing a car's
            tire
            at Audi Sport on the Lausitzring circuit, he collapsed while traveling at a speed of 300 km/h, causing the
            car
            to lift off and roll over. This incident drew parallels to the fate of the legendary Alberto Ascari. Just
            like
            Ascari, Michele Alboreto met his end away from the glamorous spotlight of racing, during a routine test
            session.</p>

      <div class="text hidden py-1">
        <p>At the age of only 44, Alboreto's life came to a close, leaving behind a storied past, a significant
          present
          in racing, and a future that undoubtedly would have extended his role as a moral guide, not only within the
          world of motorsport.</p>
        <p>Today, Michele Alboreto's lessons are still alive and strong. He was born to race, and wasn’t in this sport
          by accident—he knew everything about it. Maybe that’s why, with his smile, it feels like he’s still here with
          us.
        </p>
        <p>A champion, a friend. Thank you, Michele.</p>
