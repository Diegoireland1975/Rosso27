              Despite the high expectations of fans and the press, especially
              linked to the return (11 years after the experience of Arturo
              Merzario) of an Italian driver in a Ferrari Formula 1, the 126-C4
              was unable to prove to be competitive.

              The Ferrari 126 C4 is a Formula 1, built and fielded by Scuderia
              Ferrari in the 1984 season. Designed by Mauro Forghieri and Harvey
              Postlethwaite, it was raced by Michele Alboreto and Ren√© Arnoux.
              The fourth and last evolution of the 126 CK from 1981, although
              fast enough, it presented various reliability problems and was not
              able to fight for the world title.

              The 156/85 proved to be fast and reliable in the early part of 1985 but as the season wore on, the car
              became increasingly fragile with numerous engine and turbo failures
              throughout the season. It was this unreliability that ultimately would cost Alboreto, who actually led the
              points standings for most of the season, the drivers' championship.

              The Ferrari F1/86 was designed as a replacement for the 156/85 used in 1985, which initially proved to be
              competitive, but as the season developed had increasing reliability issues as well as lagging behind in
              the power race. The chassis and the overall design of the 1986 car was very similar to the 1985 model. The
              main concerns were in refining the aerodynamics and improving reliability.

              The Ferrari F1/86 was a Formula One car created by Scuderia Ferrari for use in the 1986 Formula One
              season. It was designed by Harvey Postlethwaite who had designed its predecessor, the 156/85. The car was
              very uncompetitive, despite the engine being regarded as one of the strongest on the grid. It was replaced
              by the Ferrari F1/87 for the 1987 season
