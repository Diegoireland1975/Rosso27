        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The Dunlop chicane was modified slightly in order to slow speeds again but also accommodate larger gravel
          traps as runoff area for the protection of motorcycle riders using the Bugatti Circuit. Frenchman Sébastien
          Enjolras lost his life in a pre-qualifying accident in his Welter Racing WR LM97-Peugeot. </p>
        <p>in this edition a
          large group of GT1 cars is competing for the victory of the race against a small number of LMP prototypes,
          this comparison is made possible by the technical standards in force: they allow the GT1 powers of over 600
          HP, a minimum weight of 950 kg and a 100-liter fuel tank; the prototypes, on the other hand, have a power of
          about 550 hp, the minimum weight is 850 kg and the petrol tank has a capacity of 80 liters.</p>
        <h3>The race</h3>
        <p>After the start of the race, the two official Porsche GT1s take the lead, pursued in the early stages by the
          TWR-Porsche; after just over an hour the Ferrari 333 Sp # 4 runs out of petrol, after 2 and a half hours the
          official McLaren # 42 of the BMW Motorsport team loses 32 minutes in the pits due to a loss of water from the
          engine. The Nissans suffer from overheating problems in the gearbox and are forced to several stops in the
          pits for repairs, the two R390 GT1s driven by the fastest crews both retire shortly after 04:00 in the morning
          after a few minutes, due to gearbox breakage.</p>
        <p>Shortly before 08:00, an accident takes away the car that was leading the race, which trivially goes off the
          track at Curva Arnage without being able to start again: what at first seemed to be a serious mistake by the
          expert Bob Wollek will be discovered - years later - to have been caused by a failure of the differential of
          his official 911 GT1. </p>
        <p> # 25 JJ Letho while driving the McLaren F1 # 42 makes a head and tail at the Mulsanne
          corner and hits the wall, despite returning to the pits the car is not repairable. Four hours from the end,
          the # 26 Porsche 911 GT1 leads the race 2 laps ahead of the pursuing TWR-Porsche, followed by three McLaren F1
          cars.
          When there are just over 2 hours to the end of the race, a twist happens, the Porsche 911 GT1 # 26 driven by
          Ralf Kelleners, who had been leading the race for 5 hours now, suddenly stops near the back of Mulsanne with
          the broken engine, the driver quickly descends while the car catches fire. A few minutes later the McLaren #
          39, which occupied the 4th position, also stopped almost at the same point where the Porsche caught fire, due
          to similar technical problems. The TWR-Porsche of the crew <strong>Michele Alboreto</strong>, Stefan
          Johansonn, and Tom
          Kristensen, wins the race, in 2nd and 3rd place two
          McLaren F1 GTRs, the first of the GTC Motorsport team and the second of the BMW Motorsport team.
